boredom, pagka-buryo, pagkatamad, that empty, restless feeling when you donâ€™t know what to do or nothing around you feels interesting.

i believe that there's beauty behind boredom.

but before that...
my question is, did we get scared of feeling bored? 

i mean we're trying so hard for not to feel it, 
one reach in our pocket, got the phone. scroll in our feeds, binge our favorite shows, and then suddenly you read that your favorite celebrity cheated on his wife. every minute and every second we were getting drown by information and entertainment, at some point we've even stopped having our own thoughts over everything.

the truth is we didn't get scared of being bored, we just found an easier way to kill it. coz since we have phones now
...pause
it got so normal to run away from this feeling, that there is always the need to fill this little silence. maybe at least for me.

but, what exactly is the importance behind boredom?

do you all remember when were little children, when we were kids, we always tend to be so curious about everything, we notice small details, and even did so much random stuff. I also think that we are so much creative back then, we can make art w/o any reference and kids back then they have original thoughts and opinion over things and much importantly, we were so much happier back then... but why? because they are easier to get bored. our attention were not being stolen every minute, and they got the chance to take a breathe,

being bored is significant because it promotes creativity and mindfullness.
when we let our mind to just sit still in slience and have time for itself, it makes space for you to create and make new ideas. it also let's us rethink of our goals, and be more mindful over our own choices.

so here's what yuo can do whn, 
what do we do when we felt bored?
1. let it be - just let it be, do not run from it just embrace it.
2. look around - there's so much thing around, be in the moment
3. challenge yourself  - test your self on things you could do, no matter how boring it is
4. keep going - because even boredom ends

well in some cases, maybe being bored isn't so much as beneficial to others. most of the reason of the drug addicts why they tried drugs for the first time is because they are bored.

but boredom successfully proves it self through history. isaac newton was in quarantine, he probably got too tired that he decided to make calculus, he was there sitting on a tree, when the apple hits his head. and he realized gravity. J.K rowling was so bored on a train that  she end up writing Harry Potter. I even write this presentation when I was bored.

this is the proof that embracing this feeling can lead to something to great.

this feeling shouldn't be something we always need to remove,  it should be something we need to embrace sometimes.

boredom helps to know ourselves a lil more better, a little more ddeeper.
